This is a portfolio project designed to help show off basic skills in:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript ES6
* Git/GitHub Version Control
* Markdown Formatting

## Project Requirements

>For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

### Project Objectives:
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript
2. Use Git version control
3. Use command line
4. Develop locally on your computer


## The Plan

This message generator will build a random meal plan for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. The vision here is simple.

* A random message needs to be generated, so there will be a 'Generate' button.
* A meal will need to be chosen, so there will be a radio button set with options for the three.
* There will also be a checkbox that can be selected to add dessert to the meal plan.
* The random message needs to be built from 3 different components, so we will choose a side, entree and drink (and dessert if chosen).
* objects for each meal type will be built with arrays for sides, entrees, drinks and desserts. These will be picked from randomly per chosen meal and output in the following syntax:
    "Your [meal type] today will be [entree choice] with a side of [side choice] and a tall glass of [drink choice]. (optional)For dessert, your taste buds should enjoy our signature [dessert choice]."

### Deadline

This will be a **one-day** project.
